# In-Toto verifications in a container

![](https://github.com/engineerd/in-toto-container/workflows/GitHub%20Actions/badge.svg)

This is a project that enables running [In-Toto][in-toto] verifications inside a Linux container.

> This project assumes familiarity with the [In-Toto Specification][in-toto-spec].

> Verification is the process by which data and metadata included in the final product is used to ensure its correctness. Verification is performed by the client by checking the supply chain layout and links for correctness, as well as by performing the inspection steps.

## Why run verifications in a container?

The main reason for providing a containerized environment for In-Toto verifications is related to dependencies - at a minimum, running an In-Toto verification [requires Python, OpenSSL, git, and pip][deps]. On top of this, individual layouts might require additional dependencies in order to execute the verification (for example, the official demo needs to execute `tar` locally). Running in a container ensures the desired dependencies and their versions are available for clients running the verifications.

Additionally, using this method, verifications can be executed on any operating system

## Requirements

We introduce the concept of a _verification image_ - a container image where verifications are performed. At a minimum, the image needs to satisfy the requirements for running the `in-toto-verify` binary, and the existence of the `/in-toto` directory at the root of the file system.

Such a container image can be built using the following Dockerfile:

```
FROM python:latest

RUN mkdir /in-toto
RUN pip install in-toto
```

## How does this work?

The root layout, keys, target files, and links directory are passed as arguments to this utility, they are copied inside the verification image in the `/in-toto` directory, and then the `in-toto-verify` utility is run in the container.

> Note that currently, the utility doesn't currently support passing all flags to `in-toto-verify`, and currently a single key is passed.
